Throughout his career he has interviewed hundreds of the most well-known innovators in the fields of advanced science and emerging technology providing him with a unique perspective on how the future might unfold. As the Host of the FUTURES Podcast (2019 - Present) he meets the pioneers working to imagine the sorts of developments that might dramatically alter what it means to be human. As the Director of Virtual Futures (2011 - Present) he brings together artists, cultural theorists, fiction writers, and technologists to re-address the potential of looking at our futures through the lens of techno-philosophy. He was the host of the Futurism documentary series ‘Science Nonfiction’ which followed his journey as he traveled across the USA to meet eight companies that were rewriting the rules of what’s possible. In each episode he learned about the development of technologies that once only existed in science fiction, but were now beginning to show up in our homes, cars, and workplaces. Luke has given visiting lectures and presentations at various UK and international institutions including the British Library, Science Museum, Royal College of Art, Royal Academy of Art, Victoria & Albert Museum, University of Warwick and the London School of Economics. He has contributed to BBC One, BBC Radio, The Guardian, Discovery Channel, VICE Motherboard and Wired Magazine.
